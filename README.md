# Data-Analysis-on-Allergic-Rhinitics
Finding out the most prevalent variables among different dependent and independent variables.
The paper(Skin Prick Test Analysis in Allergic Rhinitis Patients using Decision Tree for Allergen Selection) was written on the basis of this analysis 
Process involved in this analysis:
### Data Cleaning
* The raw dataset was loaded in the jupyter note-book. Missing  value  imputation  is  one  of  the biggest  tasks  of  data  pre-processing  when  per-forming  data  mining so we have filled the missing values with most frequent occuring values.

### Data Transformation
* The  raw  data  was  then  imported  into  Excel.Since raw data were in the format of 2 or 1 exceptfor age, which was continuous data.  For gettingan efficient format, the dataset was transposed to0 for 2 and 1 for 1

### Feature Selection

### Validation and
### Accuracy Testing
 A Research paper was also written based on this Analysis.
 
 Summary of the Analysis:
 This project investigates the relationship between Skin Prick Test(SPT) with twenty-six allergens among the patients of Allergic Rhinitis(AR) from the Kavrepalanchok district of Nepal.
A total of 170 patients were included, where the number of females was (59.4\%) more than males(40.6\%), with the youngest age was 15 years, and the oldest was 66 year. Using the datamining algorithms: Decision Tree, and Regression analysis, it was found that allergen, D.pter followed by Thyrophagus and Lepidoglyphus, which are all House Dust Mite(HDM). Apart HDM, It was found that Dog and Cat were also the determinants for the SPT occurrence and also the demography was from Kavrepalanchok district which is situated in the height of 1007 meters to 3018 meters from sea level and belongs to the tropical  region with  23.7\%  of the area and  subtropical zone with 65.3\%, having HDM as the prime allergens for allergic rhinitis was seen common.  Thus it was concluded that people belonging to a tropical and subtropical region on the need for SPT test could have first tested with D.pter, which will highly tend towards occurrences of SPT positive followed by Thyrophagus, Lepidoglyphus and age group of the twenties  were seen to be prone to AR. Rule-based classiÔ¨Åcation approach(decision tree) can assist doctors, clinicians in the diagnosis of Allergic Rhinitis to make reliable decisions for performing the Skin prick Test.
